## Environment variables:

1. JAVA_HOME - set the value path of jdk version folder where java is install on machine
2. GRADLE_HOME - set the value path of your Gradle folder location on machine

## Test, build and run the project

Once environment variables are set open the project in eclips and add testNG plugins to eclipse:

Click on Help->Install New software and add

1. TestNG Eclipse - http://beust.com/eclipse


## Gradle command to compile and run the project

Open command prompt and go to project folder and run the commands: 

### Command to clean the eclipse dependencies and download fresh dependencies and build the project.
  
```bash
Gradle cleaneclipse eclipse
Gradle build
Gradle Dependencies

```

### Compile the java Main and Java test classes. whenever there is a change in any main and java classes need to run the following commands

```bash
Gradle CompileJava
Gradle CompileTestJava

Also you can run above 2 commands in one command:  Gradle CompileJava CompileTestJava
```


### Run the test - This is for CICD Integration

Following command runs the specified task mentioned in build.gradle file and run the tests methods/class/packages provided in testNg XML file in source folder.

```bash
Gradle webTest
```
## How to prepare testNG.XML file to run methods, multiple methods and class

### Run the spacific method: <methodName> pass the method name to be run

	<classes>
		<class name="iress.com.au.web.WebModellingTestClass">
			<methods>
				<include name="methodName" />
			</methods>
		</class>
	</classes>

### Run the multiple method: <methodName1>,<methodName2> pass the method names to be run

		<class name="assessment.com.au.web.BorrowCalculatorTestClass">
			<methods>
				<include name="methodName1" />
				<include name="methodName2" />
			</methods>
		</class>
	</classes>
	
### Run the all methods from the class: <WebModellingTestClass> pass the class name to be run

	<classes>
		<class name="assessment.com.au.web.BorrowCalculatorTestClass"/>
	</classes>	
	
## Run the tests from eclipse: same testNG.XML file can be use to run the test/tests

Open the project in eclipse
Navigate to Java/Resource and open the testNG.xml file
Right click and choose Run As --> TestNG suit


## selenium - Docker - If you dont want to setup above things tp run the project - you just need to download docker on your local machine
### If you want to run the selenium tests in docker image. You need following configuration change

- Need to update the variable "runOnDocker" to "yes" in config.property file
- Docker must be install and running on you local machine

- pull the docker image selenium/standalone-chrome-debug and run

	- Docker pull selenium/standalone-chrome-debug
	- docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-chrome-debug
		
- if you want to view the execution - download: VNC viewer â€“ for running the web browsers. and following is the configuration
	-  Run the VNC viewer
	- Click on the new connection.
